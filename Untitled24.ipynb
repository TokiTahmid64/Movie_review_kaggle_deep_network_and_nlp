       "'plot   two teen couples go to a church party   drink and then drive   they get into an accident   one of the guys dies   but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life   and has nightmares   what s the deal   watch the movie and   sorta   find out       critique   a mind fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea   but presents it in a very bad package   which is what makes this review an even harder one to write   since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold   mess with your head and such   lost highway   memento     but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films   and these folks just didn t snag this one correctly   they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept   but executed it terribly   so what are the problems with the movie   well   its main problem is that it s simply too jumbled   it starts off   normal   but then downshifts into this   fantasy   world in which you   as an audience member   have no idea what s going on   there are dreams   there are characters coming back from the dead   there are others who look like the dead   there are strange apparitions   there are disappearances   there are a looooot of chase scenes   there are tons of weird things that happen   and most of it is simply not explained   now i personally don t mind trying to unravel a film every now and then   but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again   i get kind of fed up after a while   which is this film s biggest problem   it s obviously got this big secret to hide   but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes   and do they make things entertaining   thrilling or even engaging   in the meantime   not really   the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this   so we actually figured most of it out by the half way point   so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense   but it still didn t the make the film all that more entertaining   i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is   into it   even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding   i mean   showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about   minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy     okay   we get it       there are people chasing her and we don t know who they are   do we really need to see it over and over again   how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie   apparently   the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves   and it shows   there might ve been a pretty decent teen mind fuck movie in here somewhere   but i guess   the suits   decided that turning it into a music video with little edge   would make more sense   the actors are pretty good for the most part   although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty   only in a new neighborhood   but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller   who holds her own throughout the entire film   and actually has you feeling her character s unraveling   overall   the film doesn t stick because it doesn t entertain   it s confusing   it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime   despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it   oh   and by the way   this is not a horror or teen slasher flick       it s just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids   it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since   whatever       skip it   where s joblo coming from   a nightmare of elm street             blair witch             the crow           the crow   salvation           lost highway           memento           the others           stir of echoes        '"
